Welcome Page #1:

-Simple page with text reading "NAME OF APP"
-Maybe a logo
-maybe a loading screen
-Button with text that reads "Where are you eating tonight?"
-with on click function of button, it takes you to page #2


Home Page #2:


-On page load, run JS if function (navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition) to ask the user for Geolocation; [?when to
run]
-if ("geolocation" in navigator){
/* if geolocation is available */
} else {
/* geolocation is NOT available*/
}
-If users browser isn't compatible with JS geolocation function, notify user and then send form asking for user's zip
code or city.
-If form needs to be sent, pull API for list of zip codes? (Check)
-Use .then to prevent rest of page from loading before grabbing Geolocation information
-Once Geolocation is grabbed from the user, card with types of food appear
-Within card, list options of "Asian, Mexican, Italian, American".
-Have the page set up to input user location into 4square API.
-Once user clicks on one of the options, based on user Geolocation the app pulls JSON object from foursquare API;
-Set parameters on 4square object return to limit the amount of restaurants to 5
-run a for loop of the 5 restaurants, and ranomize.length
-Once loop runs, display randomized output to the screen.
-Single output is shown on screen with restaurant information from 4square
-On screen, 2 buttons are shown:
"Reset Generator" & "Eat Here"
-If user selects "Reset Generator", randomizer for loop is run again and user is shown another singular option from
4square
-If user selects "Eat Here", user is taken to Page 3.


Page #3:
-User selected "Eat Here" option.
-Bc of this, user is directed to GoogleMaps with driving directions based on their geolocation or manually inputted zip
code/city.
-Maybe add an "end message" for complete user experience?
